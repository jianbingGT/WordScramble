## 1 Introduction

Our project is a word scramble game for Android that will allow users to create and solve word scramble puzzles.

## 2 Process Description

- **Obtain Requirements**:
  - Obtain the project requirements from project stakeholders and discuss requirements in as much detail as possible to determine any non-obvious or derived requirements.
  - Requires: None - requirements were provided by instructor
  - Output: Requirements

- **Design Class Diagram**:
  - Draw class diagram for the project based on the requirements obtained in the previous action.
  - Requires: Requirements
  - Output: Class diagram that meets with all team members approval

- **Create Use Cases**:
  - Create use cases and accomplanying diagrams for the project base on project requirements and current class diagram.  Make any necessary updates to the class diagram that become apparent during this action.
  - Requires: Requirements, Class diagram
  - Output: Use case model for project, supplimental requirements list, any updates needed to class diagram

- **Create Test Plan**:
  - Create plan for testing to ensure the project meets provided requirements and all use cases in the use case model are covered.  Make any necessary updates to the class diagram and use cases that become apparent during this action.
  - Requires: Requirements, Use Cases
  - Output: Test plan, any updates needed to use case model, supplimental requirements list, or class diagram

- **Create Graphical User Interface Layout**:
  - Create the layout for the project's GUI base on project requirements, any relevant use cases and team design choices.
  - Requires: Requirements, Use Cases
  - Output: GUI layout mockup

- - **Create Design Document**:
  - Create document detailing design considerations, project architecture, low-level design, and Graphical User Interface (GUI) layout.  Make any necessary updates to the class diagram, use cases, test plan, or GUI layout that become apparent during this action.
  - Requires: Requirements, Class diagram, GUI layout
  - Output: Design document, any updates to the class diagram, use cases, test plan, or GUI layout

- **Release Cycle**:
  - **Development Cycle**:
    - **Develop Application**:
      - Implement application as directed by the requirements, class diagram, GUI layout, use cases, design document, and any corrective actions.  This step will be repeated in a cycle with Test Application until the current application version is deemed acceptable for release by the team.
      - Requires: Requirements, class diagram, GUI layout, design document, corrective actions
      - Output: Current version of the application and any updates required to the class diagram, GUI layout, or design document
    - **Test Application**:
      - Test current version of application using the test plan to ensure that it meets all requirements, satisfies all use cases, and is as bug free as possible.  This step will be repeated in an iterative cycle with the development step until the application is deemed acceptable enough for release.
      - Requires: Current version of application, test plan
      - Output: Test results, corrective actions, acceptance level
  - **Version Release**:
    - When the current version of the application is deemed acceptible by all team members it will be released users and feedback will be gathered.
    - Requires: Version of application that has been accepted by team members
    - Output: User feedback, corrective actions
  - **Update Documentation**:
    - Make updates to documentation as necessary to include user feedback generated from the Beta release.
    - Requires: User feedback, use cases, test plan, class diagram
    - Output: Updated documentation, corrective actions
